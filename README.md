# Senior Design Website Generator
This project helps create senior design websites for teams!

## Getting Started 

Getting this project up and running is quite non-trivial. One must have basic knowledge of HTML, JS, and CSS. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AditGupta25/senior-design-website.git
```

Once you have cloned the repo, you will see (2) folders:
1) senior-design-site: This can be ignored. This is just a copy of the senior design main website hosted online. It was put here just for testing purposes.
2) website-generator: This is where the magic happens. When you open this folder, you will see a few directories and files. Nonethless, you will only interact with two files! 
    (2.1) index.html --> this is the main user experience students will interact with. Hosted [here](http://www.cci.drexel.edu/SeniorDesign/2020_2021/template/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1lyYtR4I0iD-KxFC1Sb9SZNxagq29t9NNb8rZBuVnlnZediDvzosq1IDA).
    (2.2) /js/javascript.html --> This is what happens in the backend after the student clicks "submit" to create the website.
