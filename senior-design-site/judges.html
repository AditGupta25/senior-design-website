             <h2>Senior Project - Judges</h2>
             <P align="left">Each year our "Final Four" competition is assessed by a panel of external judges selected from local industry. Often the judges have a strong tie to the College of Computing and Informatics.</P>

<P align="left">Each student group provides a 20 minute presentation that is evaluated by the judges for the nature of their project, it's technical difficulty, it's impact, how well they followed software engineering principles including specification, design, implementation, and testing, how well the project worked and their presentation style. These criteria are summarized in our <a href="http://www.cci.drexel.edu/SeniorDesign/BackgroundMaterial/FinalPresRubric2016.pdf">Final Presentation Grading Rubric</a>.</P>

<P align="left">The best project is selected to represent the department in the College of Engineering Senior Design competition. A runner up is also selected. All groups receive a monetary prize.</P>
